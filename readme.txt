Smart City Road Lights
Overview

This project is a smart lighting system designed for city roads to optimize electricity usage by dynamically controlling street light intensity. The system ensures that lights only shine bright when necessary—such as during the night or when vehicles are nearby—thus minimizing energy wastage and enhancing sustainability.

Key Features

    LDR-based Day/Night Detection: Automatically switches lighting behavior based on sun light levels.

    IR Sensors for Object Detection: Detects vehicle or pedestrian movement to increase nearby light intensity.

    PWM Controlled LEDs: Lights remain dim by default at night and brighten only when activity is detected.

    Buzzer Alert: Optional buzzer indicates transition to night mode.

Objective

To develop a cost-effective, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient street lighting system that reduces unnecessary power consumption by using real-time environment feedback.

Arduino cloud integration was not possible at the moment of creating the project because I didn't have the subscription.
